# A Ruby Parser tutorial

**This tutorial will made available by Friday 9th October**

*Note that this tutorial will not work with the Ruby installation on the CS student lab machines. You can instead use the Vagrant setup for DAMS practicals as discussed in at the end of the [Vagrant tutorial](vagrant.md).*
