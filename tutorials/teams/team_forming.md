# Team Forming

Throughout DAMS, you will most often work together with your team. The purpose of this tutorial is for you to better get to know your teammates. There is intentionally very little design or maintenance; plenty of that to follow later in the term!

## Meet and greet
Find a member of your team that you don't know very well (if at all). Your goal is to interview each other to find out the following information:

* name (e.g., Louis)
* a few things that you like (Tottenham Hotspur, Northumberland and CoffeeScript)
* a few things that you dislike (Cristiano Ronaldo, mustard and JavaScript)

Produce a "business card" with an illustration of your interviewee, their name, and their likes and dislikes.

(If your team has an odd number of members, form pairs and a trio).

## Class introduction
I will ask you to briefly present your teammate and their business card to the rest of the class.

## Build a skyscraper
In your teams, build the tallest skyscraper whilst following the rules below:

* You can only use the resources provided to your team by the lecturer.
* Your tower must be able to support itself (e.g. no holding it up by hand!).
* Ingenuity is encouraged; plagiarism is not (i.e. donâ€™t search the internet for tips :-P).
* You may wish to plan your skyscraper on pen and paper before starting construction. (Some people call this design...)

## What next?
You will very likely finish all of the activities in under two hours. So, what should you do next? You could:

* Watch some of the lecture videos.
* Speak with me about videos that you have already watched.
* Start working through the DAMS [Ruby tutorial](../ruby/1_introduction.md).
